# Externalize Cycle Start Date to Config File

## Initial Prompt
> I want to add a configuration file to this project to allow me to reset the schedule. Right now it's hard coded by February 22nd 2026, but I want to be able to change the baseline using a configuration file.

## Change Summary
Extracted the hardcoded `cycleStartDate` (`2026-02-22`) from `shift-schedule.jsx` into a runtime-editable JSON configuration file. The app now fetches this value on startup and applies it without requiring a rebuild.

## What Was Done

### New file: `public/config.json`
A static JSON file served by Vite at the app's base URL. Edit `cycleStartDate` here to reset the schedule baseline:
```json
{
  "cycleStartDate": "2026-02-22"
}
```

### Modified: `src/shift-schedule.jsx`
- Added `useEffect` to the React import.
- Introduced a `DEFAULT_CYCLE_START_DATE` constant and a `cycleStartDate` state variable (initialized to the default).
- Added a `useEffect` hook that fetches `config.json` at mount time and updates `cycleStartDate` state if a valid date is found.
- Replaced the hardcoded `'2026-02-22'` string inside `getUnitOnShift` with the `cycleStartDate` state variable (local alias `cycleStart` to avoid shadowing).
- On fetch failure, the default date is retained silently.

## Technical Details
- The `public/` folder in Vite is served verbatim at the `BASE_URL` root, so `config.json` is accessible without any bundling step.
- Changing `cycleStartDate` in `config.json` takes effect on the next page load with no rebuild required.
- The value must be an ISO 8601 date string (`YYYY-MM-DD`) and should be a **Sunday** that aligns with W=0 in the 3-week shift cycle for the calculation to remain correct.
